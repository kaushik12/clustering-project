# clustering-project
Contains some of the code and results from my project on clustering sequence data for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning class in Jan '18 at NYU under Prof. Marc Scott.

The objective of this project is to look at sequence analysis and clustering sequences though a new angle of networks. This project is the first step towards this idea where I try to build a network based on transitions in the sequence data and use this to construct costs which are used in the clustering analysis. Some inputs from Network based analysis are also used to try and visualise clusters in sequences a bit better. This project is being continued towards presenting at the Society of Longitudinal and Life-course Sciences Conference (SLLS 2018). Since the data comes from a National Survey, this repository only contains some preliminary output and aggregate analysis and not the entire data and codebase used for the project.
